# First commit :
Renamed repo from Ark_Pong to Arkscendance
> *Instead of doing just a pong from scratch like it has already done, this project will be a playground to test things*
- Test things with React
- Test things with Node
- Test things with DB
- Test things with Docker
- Test things with API
- Test things with CI/CD
- Test things with existence and reality themselves

This project will help to prepare future web and mobile projects
This project will be very similar to transcendence, without the complication of the 42 project


Separated Code from Obsidian Vault in two different directory
Currently started from VSCode, might switch to JetBrains IDE as soon as possible to optimize workflow
Removed main HTML features to handle it with React later, next few commits will be on this topic (probably)
Started Obsidian Vault
